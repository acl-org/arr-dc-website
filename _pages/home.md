## Welcome!

This is the overview website for the ACL Rolling Review Data Collection (ARR-DC)
project. The ARR-DC project is a community-driven effort to collect and curate a
large-scale dataset of peer reviews and associated metadata from the ACL
community. The dataset will be used to study the peer review process in the ACL
community, and to develop new tools and methods to improve peer reviewing in our
conferences.

While peer review data collection is currently happening in the \*ACL venues
(Dycke et al. 2023), the resulting data is skewed towards papers with more
positive reviewer scores. By adapting the data collection protocol to create
more balanced data resources, we can improve the quality of this line of
research. For the current data collection protocol, as well as the changes made
in comparison to the earlier protocol, see the [Protocol page]({{ '/protocol' |
relative_url }}). Some resources to get started with the subject of NLP research
on peer review are listed on the [Resources page]({{ '/resources' | relative_url
}}).

Considering the recent developments in natural language processing, we believe
it is time to ramp up our efforts in studying peer review in our community. The
use of tools like ChatGPT for assistance during reviewing is just one example of
the changes that are happening in the peer review process. We believe that the
data collected in the ARR-DC project will be a valuable resource for the
community to study these changes and to develop new tools and methods to improve
the peer review process.

## How can I contribute?

You can contribute by donating your data to the ARR-DC corpus by signing the
respective license transfer agreements when submitting to or reviewing for \*ACL
affiliated venues. For more information, see the [Protocol page]({{ '/protocol'
| relative_url }}). It is always possible to withdraw your consent for future
donation of your data - however, note that retraction of individual data points
is infeasible after publication.

You can find answers to frequently asked questions on the [FAQ page]({{ '/faq' | relative_url }}).
